I would like to request the following space mission supplies for our upcoming lunar base expansion project:

- 150 thermal insulation sheets for habitat module construction
- 25 EVA helmet lights for our astronaut operations
- 8 field diagnostic scanners for equipment maintenance
- 50 portable power nodes for mobile power requirements
- 12 cryo-storage units for biological sample preservation
- 200 polymer containment bags for waste management
- 15 mission data tablets for crew coordination

This equipment is critical for our September 2025 lunar mission deployment. I need these supplies delivered by August 25, 2025 to our Kennedy Space Center facility for pre-launch preparation.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this space mission supply request.

Best regards,
Commander Sarah Chen
Lunar Operations Division
NASA Johnson Space Center
